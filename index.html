         <h2 class="h2">Profession</h2>
            <P class="parragraph">Throughout my career, I’ve always worked in customer service for American companies, which has not only helped me develop strong communication skills but also significantly improved my English in a professional setting. Interacting with customers on a daily basis has given me invaluable experience in handling various situations, and I’ve had the opportunity to hear some truly interesting stories along the way. The ability to communicate effectively and build rapport with people from all walks of life has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my career.
              
            Currently, I’m working with a group of lawyers, and this new role has been an amazing learning experience. I’ve been with the team for over a year now, and every day brings new insights into the legal field. I’m constantly expanding my knowledge and skills, and it’s been exciting to grow in this professional environment.
                
            In addition to my current work, I’ve recently decided to take my career in a new direction. I’m studying coding and web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The world of tech is fascinating, and I’m eager to learn everything I can. It’s been an exciting journey so far, and I’m looking forward to applying my newfound skills in the future.</P>

         <h2 class="h2">Family</h2>
            <p class="parragraph">I’m the middle child of three, and living with my parents and two brothers has always been a wonderful experience full of love, laughter, and enjoyment. Growing up in a family where everyone supported each other made my childhood truly special. My father has always been there for me, especially when it comes to sports. His encouragement pushed me to pursue my passions and achieve more than I ever thought possible. My mother, on the other hand, has always been the caring, nurturing force in our family. While she was often a little worried about the risks, especially when it came to my sports endeavors, she always supported me in her own way. She has an incredible sense of being a mother and has always made sure we feel loved and cared for, no matter what.

            Our family also includes two dogs and a cat. The dogs are full of energy and bring so much joy to our lives, while the cat, who is an impressive 18 years old, adds a touch of mystery to our household. It’s hard to believe she’s lived so long, but she’s still going strong, and we all love her dearly.
                
            In the end, we’re just a happy family, united by love, support, and a shared appreciation for the little moments that make life so special.</p>

         <h2 class="h2">Hobbies</h2>
            <p class="parragraph">I've been passionate about biking for as long as I can remember. My journey started when I was a young kid, riding BMX bikes and quickly falling in love with the thrill of speed and the freedom that came with it. As I got older, my love for cycling evolved, and I transitioned into downhill racing, where I really started to excel. The adrenaline rush of racing down steep hills at high speeds was unmatched. My dedication and hard work paid off when I achieved some great results, which led to me being sponsored by a brand. It was an incredible experience being featured in the newspaper and even on TV, something I’ll never forget.

            As I grew up, I made the decision to retire from racing and shifted my focus to cross-country biking. These days, I still enjoy riding on weekends, but now I appreciate the more laid-back pace of cross-country riding. It’s still a great way to stay active and explore new places on two wheels.
                
            When I was 16, I also got into off-road motorcycling, which has been another major hobby of mine. I bought my first motorcycle and started riding off-road, and over the years, I've upgraded my bike for better performance. Riding through rugged terrain is another experience I absolutely love, and it's a fantastic way to get outside and challenge myself in a different way.
                
            Cycling and off-road riding have always been more than just hobbies to me, they’ve shaped who I am and have been a constant source of joy and adventure throughout my life.
